##Instructions for running the application

Assuming that you have Java and Maven installed

1) run mvn clean install
2) go to the target directory
3) run java -jar danish-talpod-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
4) use postman or any other REST tool to send request to api at http://localhost:8080/createItinerary
5) attached is a sample json file for the request structure
6) output is the same json but sorted by source/destination using Euclidean algorithm.


Note : The solution can be improved upon in terms of unit tests and documentation and maybe some code cleaning.
Due to the nature of the problem and limited time I chose to focus more on handling the actual 
problem rather than writing proper documentation and unit tests.

Assumptions:
I have assumed that if there would always be an ordered unbroken list in the input.
If that is not the case then the output would be empty. Also assuming that the input would always
have a Euclidean path.
